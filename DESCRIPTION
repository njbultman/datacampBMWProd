Description: DataCamp BMW Case Study
	This package is designed for use with the DataCamp certification case study. It supplements the original model building exercise with helpful functions that make pricing new BMW data simple and efficient in a pipeline. It also contains information about the final model including the model object and the training data/script for reproducability/transparancy.
	For example, if I have a new data frame of BMW data that I want scored, I simply pass that first to the auto_clean function. Then, I pass the revised data frame to the auto_predict function to generate model predictions for price.
